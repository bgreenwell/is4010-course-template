Greenwell\n**Course:** IS4010 - AI-Enhanced Application Development\n\n---\n\n## 🏗️ Welcome to Object-Oriented Programming\n\n### The foundation of scalable software architecture 🎯\n\n**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** revolutionizes how we design and structure applications by providing:\n\n- **Real-world modeling**: Create digital representations of real-world entities and their interactions\n- **Career relevance**: Essential for modern software development, system design interviews, and team collaboration\n- **Scalability**: Build applications that can grow from prototypes to enterprise-level systems\n- **Code organization**: Transform chaotic procedural code into elegant, maintainable architectures\n\n> 📝 **Additional Notes**:\n> **Historical context**: OOP emerged in the 1960s with [Simula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula), popularized by [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) in the 1970s. **Industry adoption**: Nearly every major software system uses OOP principles - from operating systems to web frameworks. **Career impact**: OOP concepts appear in 90% of technical interviews for software engineering roles.\n\n### Real-World Examples You Use Daily\n- **Instagram**: User, Post, Comment, Story classes\n- **Banking systems**: Account, Transaction, Customer classes\n- **Games**: Player, Inventory, Character, Weapon classes\n- **E-commerce**: Product, ShoppingCart, Order, Payment classes\n\n### Learning Objectives\nBy the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n- **Distinguish** when to use classes instead of functions for complex state management\n- **Create classes** with constructors ([`__init__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__)) and string representations ([`__str__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__))\n- **Implement methods** that give objects behavior and encapsulate functionality\n- **Use inheritance** to create specialized classes and enable code reuse\n- **Apply advanced OOP concepts** like properties, class methods, and static methods\n\n### How to Use This Notebook\n- **Run each cell** by clicking the play button or pressing Shift+Enter\n- **Experiment** with the code - modify values and see what happens\n- **Complete the exercises** marked with 🏋️‍♀️ for hands-on practice\n- **Use AI assistants** to help you understand concepts or explore variations"

    "## Final Thoughts 💭\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object-oriented programming is not just about syntax - it's about thinking in terms of objects, their responsibilities, and their interactions.** This mindset will serve you well throughout your programming career, from designing simple scripts to architecting enterprise applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The patterns you've learned here - encapsulation, inheritance, and method design - form the foundation of modern software development. As you continue your journey, you'll see these concepts everywhere: in web frameworks, mobile apps, data science libraries, and game engines.\n",
