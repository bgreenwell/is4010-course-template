Hey everyone, and welcome to IS4010! This GitHub repository is your central hub for all code, labs, resources, and project submissions for the course. Please clone this repository, and be sure to pull frequently for updates.

## Course description

This course introduces students to a computer programming language with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles which include creating and manipulating classes and objects. Students will develop solutions to process data and implement algorithms in a modern integrated development environment (IDE) to support debugging and team development. Popular libraries and tools to support OOP programming, including AI-powered tools and libraries, will also be studied and applied to enhance problem-solving and application development.

## ü§ñ Our AI policy: a quick reminder

This course operates on a new, modern principle: **use AI, but use it wisely.**

Unlike the previous version of this course which restricted AI use, the use of AI tools is not only permitted but encouraged. However, remember that the goal is for *you* to learn.

1.  **You are the pilot, AI is the co-pilot.** You are responsible for every line of code you submit.
2.  **Always understand the code.** If you use AI to generate something, you must be able to explain what it does. Use the AI to help you learn, not just to produce an answer.
3.  **Acknowledge your partner.** In your final project, your team will be required to document how you used AI tools in your development process.

## üìä How grading works

This course uses an **automated grading system** that provides you with immediate, detailed feedback on your lab submissions. Here's what to expect:

### **Automatic assessment**
- Your [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository is automatically evaluated within 24-48 hours of submission
- The system checks code functionality, repository setup, documentation quality, and requirement compliance
- Scoring is objective and consistent across all students

### **GitHub issues feedback**
After grading, you'll receive personalized feedback as a **GitHub Issue** in your repository containing:
- üìä **Point breakdown** - Exactly how points were earned/lost for each component
- ‚úÖ **Success highlights** - Recognition for components that work correctly  
- üîß **Improvement guidance** - Specific next steps to address any issues
- üß™ **Test results** - For code labs, see which functions pass/fail automated tests

### **What this means for you**
- **No waiting weeks for grades** - Get feedback quickly while the assignment is fresh in your mind
- **Learn from specific examples** - See exactly which parts of your code work and which need improvement
- **Professional development** - Experience automated testing and CI/CD practices used in industry
- **More instructor time** - Automated grading frees up office hours for higher-level concept discussion

### **Example feedback**
```
üéØ Lab 2 Submission Feedback - 8/10 points (80%)

‚úÖ Repository Setup: 3/3 points - Private repo with instructor access
‚úÖ Python Functions: 4/4 points - All three functions working perfectly! 
‚ùå Markdown Content: 0/1 points - Missing problem sections in lab02_prompts.md

Next Steps: Add the three required problem sections to your markdown file...
```

**üí° Pro tip**: Students with perfect scores (10/10) won't receive feedback issues since no improvements are needed!

## ü§î Getting help

If you get stuck, help is always available. Please use the following channels:

1.  Ask a question in our class **Teams channel**.
2.  Come to my virtual or in-person office hours.
3.  Email me to schedule a separate meeting.
4.  **Review your GitHub Issues** - Automated feedback often answers common questions about your submission.

### ü§ñ AI-powered learning assistants

This section provides a summary of free Large Language Model (LLM) clients that are suitable for students. The landscape of AI tools is constantly changing, so some details may be out of date.

**üí° Pro tips for using AI in this course:**
- **Start specific**: Instead of "help me code," try "explain why this Python function returns None"
- **Share context**: Include your code, error messages, and what you're trying to accomplish
- **Learn actively**: Ask the AI to explain concepts, not just provide answers
- **Verify outputs**: Always test AI-generated code and understand what it does before submitting
