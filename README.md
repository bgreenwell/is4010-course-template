# IS4010: AI-Enhanced Application Development

Hey everyone, and welcome to IS4010! This GitHub repository is your central hub for all code, labs, resources, and project submissions for the course. Please clone this repository, and be sure to pull frequently for updates.

## Course description

This course introduces students to a computer programming language with object-oriented programming (oop) principles which include creating and manipulating classes and objects. Students will develop solutions to process data and implement algorithms in a modern integrated development environment (ide) to support debugging and team development. Popular libraries and tools to support oop programming, including ai-powered tools and libraries, will also be studied and applied to enhance problem-solving and application development.

## ü§ñ Our AI policy: a quick reminder

This course operates on a new, modern principle: **use AI, but use it wisely.**

Unlike the previous version of this course which restricted AI use, the use of AI tools is not only permitted but encouraged. However, remember that the goal is for *you* to learn.

1.  **You are the pilot, AI is the co-pilot.** You are responsible for every line of code you submit.
2.  **Always understand the code.** If you use AI to generate something, you must be able to explain what it does. Use the AI to help you learn, not just to produce an answer.
3.  **Acknowledge your partner.** In your final project, your team will be required to document how you used AI tools in your development process.

## ü§î Getting help

If you get stuck, help is always available. Please use the following channels:

1.  Ask a question in our class **teams channel**.
2.  Come to my virtual or in-person office hours.
3.  Email me to schedule a separate meeting.
