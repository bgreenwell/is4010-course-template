Hey everyone, and welcome to IS4010! This GitHub repository is your central hub for all code, labs, resources, and project submissions for the course. Please clone this repository, and be sure to pull frequently for updates.

## Course description

This course introduces students to a computer programming language with object-oriented programming (OOP) principles which include creating and manipulating classes and objects. Students will develop solutions to process data and implement algorithms in a modern integrated development environment (IDE) to support debugging and team development. Popular libraries and tools to support OOP programming, including AI-powered tools and libraries, will also be studied and applied to enhance problem-solving and application development.

## üìì Working with Course Materials

Many course topics include **three complementary resources** to support your learning:

1. **Lecture Slides** - Visual presentation for in-class lectures
2. **Interactive Jupyter Notebooks** - Hands-on coding practice
3. **Lecture Notes** - Comprehensive written guides with examples and explanations

### How These Materials Work Together

**All three resources are synchronized** and provide:

- **Same structure**: Topics covered in the same order across all formats
- **Same examples**: Code examples consistent between slides, notebooks, and notes
- **Different strengths**: Each format leverages its unique advantages

#### Lecture Slides (.qmd ‚Üí HTML)
- Visual presentation format for live lectures
- Key concepts with incremental reveals
- Historical context and real-world examples

#### Interactive Notebooks (.ipynb)
- **Executable examples**: All code can be run and modified
- **Hands-on exercises**: 8+ practice problems with immediate feedback
- **Self-paced learning**: Work through examples at your own speed
- **Lab preparation**: Patterns you'll use in assignments

#### Lecture Notes (.md)
- **Comprehensive written guide**: Detailed explanations of all concepts
- **Code examples with annotations**: Deep dives into how code works
- **Common questions answered**: Anticipates and addresses typical confusion
- **Career context**: Industry applications and interview prep

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Before/after class**: Review slides to understand core concepts
2. **Hands-on practice**: Open the companion notebook to code along
3. **Deep understanding**: Read lecture notes for comprehensive explanations
4. **Experiment freely**: Modify notebook examples to test understanding
5. **Reference for labs**: Use all three when working on assignments

**Current materials** (see course roadmap above for links):
- Week 4: Data Structures (slides, notebook)
- Week 5: Functions and Error Handling (slides, notebook)
- Week 6: Object-Oriented Programming (slides, notebook, lecture notes)

More materials will be added as the semester progresses!

### Opening Notebooks in VS Code

**VS Code has built-in Jupyter notebook support!** Here's how to get started:

1. **Install the Jupyter extension** (if not already installed):
   - Open VS Code
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Jupyter" by Microsoft
   - Click Install

2. **Open a notebook**:
   - Click on any `.ipynb` file in the file explorer
   - VS Code will automatically open it in the notebook editor
   - You can also clone the [instructor materials repository](https://github.com/bgreenwell/is4010-instructor-materials) to access notebooks

3. **Run code cells**:
   - Click the play button (‚ñ∂) next to any code cell
   - Or use Shift+Enter to run a cell and move to the next one
   - Python will execute the code and display results inline

4. **Select your Python interpreter**:
   - Click "Select Kernel" in the top-right corner
   - Choose your Python 3.10+ environment

### Helpful Resources
- **[Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)** - Official VS Code documentation
- **[Jupyter Notebook Basics](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html)** - Learn notebook fundamentals
- **[Python Interactive Window](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py)** - VS Code Python features

### Alternative: JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook
If you prefer the classic Jupyter interface:
```bash
# Install Jupyter
pip install jupyter

# Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook

# Or launch JupyterLab (modern interface)
jupyter lab
```

**üí° Pro tip**: VS Code's notebook support is excellent for keeping everything in one place alongside your Python files!

## ü§ñ Our AI policy: a quick reminder

This course operates on a new, modern principle: **use AI, but use it wisely.**

Unlike the previous version of this course which restricted AI use, the use of AI tools is not only permitted but encouraged. However, remember that the goal is for *you* to learn.

1.  **You are the pilot, AI is the co-pilot.** You are responsible for every line of code you submit.
2.  **Always understand the code.** If you use AI to generate something, you must be able to explain what it does. Use the AI to help you learn, not just to produce an answer.
3.  **Acknowledge your partner.** In your final project, your team will be required to document how you used AI tools in your development process.

## üìä How grading works

This course uses an **automated grading system** that provides you with immediate, detailed feedback on your lab submissions. Here's what to expect:

### **Automatic assessment**
- Your [GitHub](https://github.com/) repository is automatically evaluated within 24-48 hours of submission
- The system checks code functionality, repository setup, documentation quality, and requirement compliance
- Scoring is objective and consistent across all students

### **GitHub issues feedback**
After grading, you'll receive personalized feedback as a **GitHub Issue** in your repository containing:
- üìä **Point breakdown** - Exactly how points were earned/lost for each component
- ‚úÖ **Success highlights** - Recognition for components that work correctly  
- üîß **Improvement guidance** - Specific next steps to address any issues
- üß™ **Test results** - For code labs, see which functions pass/fail automated tests

### **What this means for you**
- **No waiting weeks for grades** - Get feedback quickly while the assignment is fresh in your mind
- **Learn from specific examples** - See exactly which parts of your code work and which need improvement
- **Professional development** - Experience automated testing and CI/CD practices used in industry
- **More instructor time** - Automated grading frees up office hours for higher-level concept discussion

### **Example feedback**
```
üéØ Lab 2 Submission Feedback - 8/10 points (80%)

‚úÖ Repository Setup: 3/3 points - Private repo with instructor access
‚úÖ Python Functions: 4/4 points - All three functions working perfectly! 
‚ùå Markdown Content: 0/1 points - Missing problem sections in lab02_prompts.md

Next Steps: Add the three required problem sections to your markdown file...
```

**üí° Pro tip**: Students with perfect scores (10/10) won't receive feedback issues since no improvements are needed!

## ü§î Getting help

If you get stuck, help is always available. Please use the following channels:

1.  Ask a question in our class **Teams channel**.
2.  Come to my virtual or in-person office hours.
3.  Email me to schedule a separate meeting.
4.  **Review your GitHub Issues** - Automated feedback often answers common questions about your submission.
