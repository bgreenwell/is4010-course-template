# Midterm project: data-driven python application

## Objective
The goal of this midterm project is to apply all the concepts from the first half of the course to build a complete, data-driven python application. You will demonstrate your ability to structure a program using functions and classes, consume and process data from an external source, handle errors gracefully, and partner with AI tools to improve your development workflow.

***
## Core requirements
Your project must be a command-line interface (cli) application that does the following:

* **Consumes external data**: Your application's primary data source must be one of the following:
    * A public web api of your choice.
    * A local data file that you provide (e.g., a `.csv` or `.json` file).
* **Models data with classes**: You must create at least one custom python class to model the data you are working with (e.g., a `WeatherReport` class, a `Pokemon` class, etc.). This class should contain the relevant attributes from your data source.
* **Processes data**: Your application must perform some meaningful processing on the data. This could include filtering for specific criteria, performing calculations, or sorting the results.
* **Presents data**: The final processed data must be presented to the user in a clean, human-readable format in the terminal.
* **Handles errors**: Your code must include `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle potential runtime errors, such as failed api requests, missing files, or unexpected data formats.

***
## Technical stack
Your project must be built using python and incorporate the following concepts we have covered:

* **Functions**: Code must be organized into logical, single-purpose functions.
* **Object-oriented programming**: You must use a custom `class` to model your data.
* **External libraries**: You must use at least one external python library (e.g., `requests` for apis). Dependencies should be listed in a `requirements.txt` file.
* **Error handling**: `try...except` blocks must be used to prevent the application from crashing.

***
## AI partnership
The use of AI tools like github copilot and gemini is not only permitted but **highly encouraged**. You should use these tools for brainstorming ideas, generating boilerplate code, refactoring, and debugging. A portion of your grade will be based on your reflection of this process.

***
## Deliverables
Your final submission will consist of a private github repository containing the following:

1.  All of your python source code.
2.  A `requirements.txt` file listing any external libraries needed to run your project.
3.  A detailed `README.md` file that includes:
    * A description of your application and what it does.
    * Instructions on how to set up and run your project.
4.  A `REFLECTION.md` file that answers the following guiding questions about your AI partnership:
    * Describe a specific instance where an AI assistant (Copilot or Gemini) significantly accelerated your development process. Please include the prompt or code comment you used.
    * Provide an example of a "bad" or unhelpful suggestion from the AI. Why do you think it failed to provide a good solution?
    * How did using AI tools change your approach to debugging or solving problems you got stuck on?
    * Estimate what percentage of your final submitted code was initially generated by an AI assistant. How much time did you spend refactoring or correcting that code?

***
## Timeline

* **Project kickoff**: Week 8, session 15.
* **In-class workshops**: Week 8, sessions 15 & 16.
* **Due date**: Your project is due at the start of class in **Week 9, Session 18**. We will have a low-pressure "show and tell" for volunteers during this session.
