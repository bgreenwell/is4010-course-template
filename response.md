## Question 5: Understanding Consumer Behavior

You're on the right track with your thinking! The ultimate goal of a business is, of course, to increase profits. However, this question asks what understanding consumer behavior *directly* leads to.

Think of it like a chain of events:
1.  You use analytics to understand consumer behavior.
2.  This new understanding allows you to create **better pricing strategies**, reduce marketing risks, and lower advertising costs by targeting the right people.
3.  These improved strategies then lead to the final outcome: **more profits**.

So, while more profits are the end goal, they are an *indirect* result. The most direct result of understanding your customers is the ability to make smarter, more informed business decisions, such as setting better prices.

* **Correct Answer:** better pricing strategies

## Question 8: Types of Analytics

You have the definitions exactly right!
* **Predictive Analytics:** "What could happen?"
* **Prescriptive Analytics:** "What should we do about it?"

The key here is what the forecast *itself* is doing. The forecast is identifying areas "where crimes are *likely to occur*." That's a prediction. It's answering the "What could happen?" question.

If the system went a step further and said, "Because crime is likely in Area X, dispatch three patrol cars to these specific streets between 9 PM and 1 AM," that would be **prescriptive**. It would be recommending a specific course of action.

Since the tool is just providing the forecast of where crime will likely be, it's performing **predictive analytics**. The police department then uses that prediction to decide what to do.

* **Correct Answer:** predictive analytics

## Question 19: Z-Score Calculation

You nailed it! Your mistake was using the overall average (35 minutes) given in the problem's introduction instead of the average for the specific group you were asked about (public transport users).

The z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean *of its own group*.

Here's the correct calculation for the public transport data:
1.  **Data points for Public Transport:** {30, 29, 25, 20, 27, 32, 37, 38, 21, 35}
2.  **Value to test ($x$)**: 29 (the second employee)
3.  **Calculate the Sample Mean ($\bar{x}$)**:
    $$\bar{x} = \frac{30+29+25+20+27+32+37+38+21+35}{10} = \frac{294}{10} = 29.4$$
4.  **Calculate the Sample Standard Deviation ($s$)**: This is approximately $6.275$.
5.  **Calculate the z-score**:
    $$z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{s} = \frac{29 - 29.4}{6.275} = \frac{-0.4}{6.275} \approx -0.0637$$
6.  **Round to two decimal places**: -0.06

Your corrected answer of **-0.06** is spot on. Great job figuring that out.

## Question 30: Sample vs. Population

This question is about understanding the core definitions of statistics.
* **Population:** The entire group of interest. In this case, the manager wants to know about the satisfaction of *all drive-thru customers*. So, "All customers who use the drive-thru window" is the population.
* **Sample:** A smaller, representative subset of the population that is actually studied. The manager isn't asking everyone; they are only asking *every fifth customer*.

Therefore, the group that makes up the sample is the group of people who are actually surveyed.

* **Correct Answer:** All survey respondents

Keep up the great work. Let me know if you have any more questions!
