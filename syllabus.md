# IS4010: AI-enhanced application development

## Course information

*   **Title**: IS4010: AI-enhanced application development
*   **Course #**: IS4010
*   **Credit hours**: 3
*   **Term**: [Term, e.g., Fall 2025]
*   **Prerequisites**: None

## Course description

This course introduces students to computer programming with a focus on object-oriented principles and the integration of AI-powered tools. Students will develop solutions to process data and implement algorithms in a modern integrated development environment (IDE). The curriculum begins with Python fundamentals and transitions to the Rust programming language for more advanced topics. A central theme is the practical application of AI code assistants (like GitHub Copilot and Gemini) to enhance problem-solving, accelerate development, and prepare students for the future of software engineering.

## Student learning outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the learner will be able to:

*   Develop and debug programs in Python and Rust.
*   Apply object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create and manipulate classes and objects.
*   Control program flow using conditional logic and loops.
*   Store and manipulate collections of data using appropriate data structures like lists and dictionaries.
*   Write robust programs that gracefully handle unexpected errors.
*   Fetch and process data from external files (JSON) and web APIs.
*   Use Git and GitHub for version control in a collaborative environment.
*   Write effective prompts to leverage AI assistants for code generation, explanation, and debugging.
*   Understand the core concepts of Rust, including ownership, borrowing, and error handling.

## Course materials

*   **Required**: There is no required textbook. All course materials, including lecture slides, lab instructions, and resources, are available on Canvas and the course GitHub repository.
*   **Required tools**:
    *   Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
    *   Git & a GitHub account
    *   Python 3.10+
    *   The Rust programming language toolchain
    *   GitHub Copilot (available for free via the GitHub Student Developer Pack)

## Instructional methods

This course utilizes a hands-on, lab-focused approach. Class time will consist of mini-lectures, live coding demonstrations, and extensive hands-on workshops where students can work on assignments with direct support from the instructor. The course uses Canvas for announcements and grade tracking, and GitHub for all code and assignment submissions.

## Course and grading policies

### Academic integrity & AI policy

This course operates on a modern principle: **use AI, but use it wisely.** The use of AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Gemini is not only permitted but encouraged. However, the goal is for *you* to learn.

1.  **You are the pilot, AI is the co-pilot.** You are ultimately responsible for every line of code you submit.
2.  **Always understand the code.** If you use AI to generate something, you must be able to explain what it does, how it works, and why it's the correct solution.
3.  **Acknowledge your partner.** In your final project, you will be required to document how you used AI tools in your development process.

Submitting code you do not understand is considered academic misconduct. The Lindner College of Business “Two Strikes Policy” is in effect.

### Accessibility resources

The University of Cincinnati provides reasonable accommodation to students with disabilities through the Accessibility Resources office. If you have a disability that may influence your performance in this course, please meet with the Accessibility Resources Office to arrange for accommodations. You can email AccessResources@uc.edu or call 513-556-6823 to initiate the process.

### Grading

| Assignment            | Weight  |
| --------------------- | ------- |
| Lab assignments       | 40%     |
| Midterm project       | 25%     |
| Final project         | 30%     |
| Participation & professionalism | 5%      |

## Course schedule

This schedule is tentative and subject to change at the instructor's discretion. A more detailed schedule with specific due dates is available on Canvas.
