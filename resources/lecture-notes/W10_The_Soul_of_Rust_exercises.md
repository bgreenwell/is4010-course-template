## Exercise 1: Understanding Moves

### Concept Focus
Basic ownership transfer (move semantics)

### Exercise Description
Fix the code below so it compiles. The problem is that `s1` is used after its ownership has moved to `s2`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;
    println!("s1: {}, s2: {}", s1, s2);
}
```

### Possible Solutions
- Option A: Clone `s1` so both variables own their own data
- Option B: Keep `s1` as the owner and create a reference for `s2`
- Option C: Don't use `s1` after the move

### AI Prompting Tips
If you're stuck:
- *"Why does Rust complain about using s1 after moving it to s2?"*
- *"What's the difference between move and copy in Rust? Why does String move?"*
- *"How can I use a String value in multiple places without moving it?"*

### Learning Goals
- âœ… Understand that `String` doesn't implement `Copy`
- âœ… Recognize "value used after move" errors
- âœ… Know the difference between `clone()` and borrowing

fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello world");
    let len = calculate_length(/* your code here */);
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s, len);
}

fn calculate_length(/* your function signature here */) -> usize {
    // your implementation here
}
```

## Exercise 6: The Borrow Checker - Mixing Mutable and Immutable

### Concept Focus
Understanding the "no mixing" rule for references

### Exercise Description
Fix this code that tries to have both immutable and mutable references active at the same time.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s;      // Immutable reference
    let r2 = &s;      // Another immutable reference (OK)
    let r3 = &mut s;  // Mutable reference (ERROR!)

    println!("{}, {}, {}", r1, r2, r3);
}
```

### Hint
Remember that with Non-Lexical Lifetimes (NLL), a reference's scope ends at its last use, not at the closing brace.

### AI Prompting Tips
- *"Why can't I borrow as mutable while immutable borrows exist?"*
- *"Explain Non-Lexical Lifetimes in Rust"*
- *"How do I restructure code to satisfy the borrow checker?"*

### Learning Goals

## Exercise 7: Preventing Dangling References

### Concept Focus
Understanding how Rust prevents use-after-free bugs

### Exercise Description
This code attempts to return a reference to data that will be dropped. Fix it by returning the owned value instead of a reference.

```rust
fn dangle() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    &s  // ERROR: s will be dropped, but we're returning a reference to it!
}

fn main() {
    let reference = dangle();
    println!("{}", reference);
}
```

## Exercise 8: Basic Lifetimes

### Concept Focus
Understanding when lifetime annotations are needed

### Exercise Description
Implement the `longest` function that returns the longer of two string slices. You'll need to add lifetime annotations.

```rust
fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("long string is long");
    let string2 = String::from("short");

    let result = longest(&string1, &string2);
    println!("The longest string is: {}", result);
}

fn longest(/* add lifetime parameter and signatures */) -> /* add return type */ {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

## Exercise 9: Scope and Ownership

### Concept Focus
Understanding scope-based automatic cleanup

### Exercise Description
Predict when each `drop()` will be called in this code. Then uncomment the println statements and see which ones cause errors.

```rust
fn main() {
    {
        let s1 = String::from("inner scope");
        // println!("s1: {}", s1);
    } // s1 dropped here

    // println!("s1: {}", s1); // Will this work?

    let s2 = String::from("outer scope");
    // println!("s2: {}", s2);

    {
        let s3 = String::from("nested");
        // println!("s2: {}, s3: {}", s2, s3);
    } // s3 dropped here

    // println!("s2: {}, s3: {}", s2, s3); // Will this work?
} // s2 dropped here
```

Complete this exercise by choosing the best approach for each scenario. Consider performance and ownership requirements.

```rust
fn print_length(s: /* &String or String? */) {
    println!("Length: {}", s.len());
}

fn modify_string(s: /* &mut String or String? */) {
    // Should modify the original string
    s.push_str(" - modified");
}

fn take_ownership(s: /* String */) {
    // Should take ownership and drop at end
    println!("Taking: {}", s);
}

fn main() {
    let mut original = String::from("test");

    // Call each function appropriately
    print_length(/* ? */);
    modify_string(/* ? */);
    // Can we still use original after these calls?

    take_ownership(/* ? */);
    // Can we still use original now?
}

## Bonus Challenge: String Slices and Lifetimes

### Concept Focus
Advanced: Working with string slices and lifetime relationships

### Exercise Description
Implement a function that returns the first word from a string. The return value should be a string slice that references the original string.

```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    // Return everything up to the first space
    // Hint: Use .find(' ') and slicing with &s[0..index]
    // What if there's no space? Return the whole string.
}

fn main() {
    let sentence = String::from("Hello world from Rust");
    let word = first_word(&sentence);
    println!("First word: {}", word);

    // Bonus: Why is this signature safe without explicit lifetime annotations?
}
```
